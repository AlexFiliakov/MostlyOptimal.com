# Ergodicity Advantage Landing Page Approach Document

## Website Audience

The target audience is corporate insurance buyers like CFOs and sophisticated, forward-thinking Risk Managers.

## Website Goal

Get visitors excited about the Ergodicity business modeling framework, drive them to the Getting Started page on "https://docs.ergodicityadvantage.com/api/tutorials/01_getting_started.html" and later link to my research papers.

## Communication Approach

1. The website should feel bright, airy, and energizing, so I'm avoiding a black backgrounds in favor of mainly light negative space. Style should be clean and conservative.

2. Use existing website's content or ask me for anything additional.

3. For my target audience of CFOs and Risk Managers, I'd like a more approachable, innovative, down-to-earth-yet-forward-thinking tone that makes my project less intimidating. I'm more trying to get them interested rather than position myself as an authority, so prioritizing an approachable tone is more important.
